INTRO:
This documents the changes made to base Uebimiau-2.7.8RC1 for
the (so called) jimjag version.

First of all: This "version" would be nowhere without the
effort of many beta testers, other bug-and-patch submitters,
and, most importantly, Aldoir Ventura <aldoir@users.sourceforge.net>
who gave us Uebimiau in the first place!

LICENSE:
As anyone who knows me can attest, I have a very deep
attachment to the Apache License. However, Uebimiau was,
and is, released under the GPL, so this "version" is
so licensed as well.

NOTES:
Some changes required additions to be made to the language
files; however, I am only able to update the en_UK.txt
file. Also, some themes were adjusted to provide more
information to the user. Old 2.7.8 themes will still
work, but they won't display the new infomation.

My main design consideration for all patches and improvements
where to provide a very robust alternate method for accessing
Email: my client's main method is still using dedicated
Email clients (OS X Mail, Outlook, etc...) with Uebimiau
as an alternate method.

TODO:
Figure out way to auto-empty trash and spam at *login* as
well as at logout (since many people don't bother to
actually logout).

CHANGELOG:

--------
2.7.8p3
--------
 * "What is SPAM" regex now definable for each UM class.

 * Enable auto-population of the spam folder and
   add a user pref to auto-delete it at logout time.
   Spam folder options require the _autospamfolder
   variable in the Uebimiau class be TRUE.
     o en_UK.txt: spam_extended
                  prf_empty_spam_on_exit
     o preferences.htm

 * Make the spam folder a system folder.

 * If using cookies, have the login page explain why
   a login may not have succeeded due to cookie error
   (eg: user does not have cookies enabled). Only important
   if using cookie security. This required changes to the
   login themes and the lang file.
     o en_UK.txt :lng_cookie_not_enabled
                  lng_cookie_not_valid
     o login.htm

 * Store version number in pref's file; since new versions
   might change or add preferences, this means that UM
   can now direct the user to their Preferences page
   as soon as the login after an upgrade (similar to
   the First Login). Updated preference page theme.
     o preferences.htm

 * Address book now usable with CC and BCC fields.
     o newmsg.htm

 * Fold in many improvements submitted by MBR (Martin
   Blapp) regarding file and folder speedups, detection
   of ATOP and pipelining support, and spam folders.

--------
2.7.8p2
--------
 * Change format of session ID to be more file system
   friendly.

 * Folders are now mode 700, for security.

 * No longer depend on the bundled versions of PHPMailer
   or Smarty, which were kind of old. Instead, force any
   custom changes to these external projects to be local
   in scope, allowing us to upgrade them as needed, or to
   use system-installed versions. (we *do* bundle what we
   need, for completeness, and to make it a one-shot
   installation - we just bundle the latest, non-altered
   versions, but we don't require the version we bundle).

 * Fix some incorrect regex matching, especially when they
   touch the file system (like allowed folder names).

 * Fix MSIE display errors (usually exhibited as just a
   blank page) especially with attachments.

 * On login, do the inbox/attachments clean-up. Many people
   don't bother to logout. :)

 * Auto-clean the server-side inbox and attachments
   folder to save disk space.

 * Misc code cleanups.
