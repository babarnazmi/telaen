INTRO:
This documents the changes made to Telaen.

First of all: Telaen would be nowhere without the
effort of many beta testers, other bug-and-patch submitters,
and, most importantly, Aldoir Ventura <aldoir@users.sourceforge.net>
who gave us Uebimiau, on which Telaen is based, in the first place!

LICENSE:
Telaen is released under the GPL.


CHANGELOG:

----------------------------------------------------------------
Telaen:
----------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.0:

 * Some under-the-hood code improvements.

 * Remove the SPAM folder from the list of
   "folders that stuff can be moved to by the
   user."

 * The Advanced HTML Editor is now TinyMCE, which
   is bundled with Telaen. Changes to the newmsg.htm
   template file may be required (depending on the
   template) to fully use this.

 * Now, whenever Telaen adds body content (eg: whenever
   we Decode), we choose to sanitize or not. This means
   that messages are sanitized when printed or
   forwarded/replied to. Added a global variable,
   $sanitize_html to control this ($allow_scripts
   also works, but is being depreciated since it
   doesn't reflect what we're really concerned about).

 * Fixed bug where show_body was not using the correct
   charset (since it was removed by HTMLFilter).

 * Removed old krufty session code to use native PHP session()
   capability.

 * Removed the tid/lid/sid stuff from the URL. Stored in
   user sessions, as it should be.

1.0.0:

 * Revised de.txt and pt_BR.txt files.
 
1.0.0-RC2:

 * Fix the default theme to use a draft Telaen logo
   instead of the old Uebimiau one.

 * The preferences page is now shown whenever the
   previously used version and the present version differ
   by either the Major or Minor version number. For example,
   moving from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 will not make it happen, but
   going from 1.0.4 to 1.1.0 will. This therefore sets
   the assumption of what the "API" is :)

 * HTML Emails are now filtered through HTMLFilter,
   to protect against XSS attacks.

 * We no longer get that weird '1' on the upper left of
   the message list page.

 * Add in a method to adjust for server timezone offsets, if we
   can't figure out the real offset.

 * Use output buffering within process.php to prevent breakage
   with redirects.

 * Force exit after all redirects.

 * All redirects are now HTTP/1.1 compliant (ie: the use
   absolute URLs).

 * Some HTML cleanups for the default theme.

1.0.0-RC1:

 * Fix calculation of timezones.

 * Rename of class files and other notices from Uebimiau to
   Telaen.

 * Enable marking READ messages as either READ or
   UNREAD upon logout. The default is UNREAD. This allows
   users who check their mail with other Email clients
   to see those messages as "new" and unread. SysAdmin can
   overrule user prefs by setting:
      $force_unmark_read_overrule;
      $force_unmark_read_settingyes;
   in config.php.
   Changes:
     o en_UK.txt: prf_unmark_read_on_exit
     o preferences.htm

----------------------------------------------------------------
Uebimiau - the "jimjag" patches:
----------------------------------------------------------------
--------
2.7.8p3
--------
 * "What is SPAM" regex now definable for each UM class.

 * Enable auto-population of the spam folder and
   add a user pref to auto-delete it at logout time.
   Spam folder options require the _autospamfolder
   variable in the Uebimiau class be TRUE.
     o en_UK.txt: spam_extended
                  prf_empty_spam_on_exit
     o preferences.htm

 * Make the spam folder a system folder.

 * If using cookies, have the login page explain why
   a login may not have succeeded due to cookie error
   (eg: user does not have cookies enabled). Only important
   if using cookie security. This required changes to the
   login themes and the lang file.
     o en_UK.txt :lng_cookie_not_enabled
                  lng_cookie_not_valid
     o login.htm

 * Store version number in pref's file; since new versions
   might change or add preferences, this means that UM
   can now direct the user to their Preferences page
   as soon as the login after an upgrade (similar to
   the First Login). Updated preference page theme.
     o preferences.htm

 * Address book now usable with CC and BCC fields.
     o newmsg.htm

 * Fold in many improvements submitted by MBR (Martin
   Blapp) regarding file and folder speedups, detection
   of ATOP and pipelining support, and spam folders.

--------
2.7.8p2
--------
 * Change format of session ID to be more file system
   friendly.

 * Folders are now mode 700, for security.

 * No longer depend on the bundled versions of PHPMailer
   or Smarty, which were kind of old. Instead, force any
   custom changes to these external projects to be local
   in scope, allowing us to upgrade them as needed, or to
   use system-installed versions. (we *do* bundle what we
   need, for completeness, and to make it a one-shot
   installation - we just bundle the latest, non-altered
   versions, but we don't require the version we bundle).

 * Fix some incorrect regex matching, especially when they
   touch the file system (like allowed folder names).

 * Fix MSIE display errors (usually exhibited as just a
   blank page) especially with attachments.

 * On login, do the inbox/attachments clean-up. Many people
   don't bother to logout. :)

 * Auto-clean the server-side inbox and attachments
   folder to save disk space.

 * Misc code cleanups.
