INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------
- Read the README file... really, you should!

- Unpack the package (.tar.gz or .zip file) into temporary directory. 

- Move the 'telaen' folder to where you want it under your
  public webspace.
  eg /home/httpd/webmail (*unix) or c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webmail (Win32).
  
- Make a non web-shared folder (users cannot see this folder throught a web
  browser), eg. /home/telaen or c:\winnt\temp\telaen

- IMPORTANT: If using the bundled Smarty package, move the ./smarty_move_me/
  directory to a non web-shared folder.
 
- The user which the webserver is running (nobody, apache, IUSR_machine,etc)
  need permission to write on this folder. It is best to make
  it owned by the webserver ID and mode 700.

- In the "telaen/inc/" directory, copy the following files to their
  new names:
  
     config.languages.php.default  ->  config.languages.php
     config.php.default            ->  config.php
     config.security.php.default   ->  config.security.php
     
- Open all the "inc/config*php" files in a text editor; all instructions are
  commented on this file, pay attention on the $temporary_folder variable and
  the SMARTY_DIR define, set them according your above folder names.

- Check your installation setup by performing the following
  tasks:
      o Rename extra/check_install.php.txt to extra/check_install.php
      o Access check_install.php via your browser, eg:
             http://www.telaen.com/telaen/extra/check_install.php
      o Make any required changes.
      o Be SURE to REMOVE check_install.php or RENAME it back to
        check_install.php.txt !!!

- If not using the bundled version of Smarty, be sure to copy the
  function.um_welcome_message.php.txt in the 'patches'
  directory file to your Smarty plugins folder (rename it to
  function.um_welcome_message.php)!

UPGRADING
---------------

Upgrading should be a painless affair. You can install
the new tarball or zip file right over the old one. Since
we do not bundle the "local" config files, just their
"default" versions (see above, eg: config.php.default),
your old configuration will be saved.

Sometimes, after upgrading, especially if this is the
first time you've installed Telean and have previously
been using Uebimiau, you may be surprised by blank
pages! This is because there is a mismatch between the
pre-compiled Smarty templates and the "new" ones.
To resolve this, delete all the directories in the
temporary folder that start with '%%': These are the
precompiled templates. By removing them, you force
Smarty to re-recompile them again, fixing the blank-page
problem.

If upgrading from Telaen 1.1.0 (or earlier) to 1.1.1 (or later),
please be sure to check your config.php file against the
config.php.default file. In particular, ensure that you have
the correct values for $default_umask, $dirperm and $webmail_title
in your config.php file for backwards compatibility (the defaults
need to be set).
If upgrading from 1.1.0 (or earlier) to 1.1.1 (or later) also note 
that the themes are NOT COMPATIBLE with the previous versions !!!
You need to reconfigure your header and footer (if you have a 
personalized one). See CHANGELOG.txt for details.
Please ask on telean forum (www.telaen.com) if you need help.

PERFORMANCE
---------------

The performance of Telaen, of course, depends on the speed of
your Webserver, PHP and your POP3/IMAP Email server. Even so,
here are some helpful hints:

  a. Use Apache 2.2.
  b. Just for Telaen, configure PHP with a large memory
     allocation and a long (or non-existant) time-limit.
  c. Use a good PHP cache, like XCache or APC.
  d. If possible, host your Email server on your Web server,
     so you can connect to the loopback address.
  e. IMAP itself is a faster interface, so use that if you can.
  f. If using POP3, there are some additional hints:
     1. Encourage people to use Folders and to keep their
        Inbox as small as possible.
     2. Remove any SPAM as quickly as possible.
  g. Enabling quotas involves some overhead which you
     may wish to avoid.
