INSTALL
----------------------------------------------------
- Read the README file... really, you should!
- Unpack the package (.tar.gz or .zip file) into a directory within your
  web server,
  eg /home/httpd/webmail (*unix) or c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webmail (Win32). 

- Make a non web-shared folder (users cannot see this folder throught a web
  browser), eg. /home/telaen or c:\winnt\temp\telaen

- The user which the webserver is running (nobody, apache, IUSR_machine,etc)
  need permission to write on this folder. It is best to make
  it owned by the webserver ID and mode 700.

- In the "inc/" directory, copy the following files to their
  new names:
  
     config.languages.php.default  ->  config.languages.php
     config.php.default            ->  config.php
     config.security.php.default   ->  config.security.php
     
- Open all the "inc/config*php" files in a text editor; all instructions are
  commented on this file, pay attention on the $temporary_folder variable,
  set it according your above folder name
