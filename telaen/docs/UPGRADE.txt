UPGRADING
---------------

Upgrading should be a painless affair. You can install
the new tarball or zip file right over the old one. Since
we do not bundle the "local" config files, just their
"default" versions (see above, eg: config.php.default),
your old configuration will be saved. However, if upgrading
from pre-1.3.0 to 1.3.0 or later, see the below.

Sometimes, after upgrading, especially if this is the
first time you've installed Telean and have previously
been using Uebimiau, you may be surprised by blank
pages! This is because there is a mismatch between the
pre-compiled Smarty templates and the "new" ones.
To resolve this, delete all the directories in the
temporary folder that start with '%%': These are the
precompiled templates. By removing them, you force
Smarty to re-recompile them again, fixing the blank-page
problem.

If upgrading from Telaen 1.1.0 (or earlier) to 1.1.1 (or later),
please be sure to check your config.php file against the
config.php.default file. In particular, ensure that you have
the correct values for $default_umask, $dirperm and $webmail_title
in your config.php file for backwards compatibility (the defaults
need to be set).

If upgrading from 1.1.0 (or earlier) to 1.1.1 (or later) also note 
that the themes are NOT COMPATIBLE with the previous versions !!!
You need to reconfigure your header and footer (if you have a 
personalized one). See CHANGELOG.txt for details.
Please ask on telean forum (www.telaen.com) if you need help.

If upgrading from a pre-1.3.0 version of Telaen, please note
that some files have changed their locations. In particular
all class.*.php files are now located in ./inc/class/ and
all config.*.php files are now located in ./inc/config/.
These means that you will need to move/install your old config
files to the new locations. You will for sure need to adjust
config.php since the require() locations for the 2 other
config files have changed.

If you install the new version overtop the old one, you will also
need to remove the class.*.php files that are left over from the
older version and live in ./inc/ (eg: ./inc/class.telaen.php). In
both cases, the check_install.php script will warn you.

Finally, be SURE that the ./inc/ directory is disabled, ala:

<Location /webmail/inc>
  order allow,deny
  deny from all
</Location>
