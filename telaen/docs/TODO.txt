Telaen TODO List: Pick an issue and have fun!

 *) Cleanup and remove the old nasty Session setup and
    use PHP sessions.

 *) SPAM Detection:
    Make the "spam detection" regex user controllable, not just
    admin controllable. Likely requires looking at X-Spam-Level
    email header.

 *) Website:
    Needs work :)
